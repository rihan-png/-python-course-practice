## Python Learning & Practice Repository

This repository is forked from CodeWithHarry's Python course.
I use it to learn Python by rewriting examples,
adding my own practice, notes, and small improvements.

### What I am doing here
- Rewriting course code in my own way
- Adding comments and explanations
- Creating small practice programs
- Learning Git and GitHub workflow

### Status
Ongoing learning (updated weekly)
