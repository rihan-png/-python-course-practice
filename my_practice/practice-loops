# My Data Analysis Practice: Loops
# This script shows how to process data lists using loops.

def analyze_data():
    
    # --- PART 1: The 'For' Loop (Iterating through an Array/List) ---
    # Scenario: I have a list of daily sales figures. I want to print each one.
    print("1. Reading Daily Sales Data:")
    daily_sales = [150, 200, 350, 400, 500]
    
    # "sale" is a variable that holds one number at a time from the list
    for sale in daily_sales:
        print("Processing sale amount: $", sale)

    print("-" * 30)

    # --- PART 2: Filtering Data (Loop with Condition) ---
    # Scenario: I only want to count days where sales were high (above 300).
    print("2. Filtering High Sales (> 300):")
    
    count = 0
    for sale in daily_sales:
        if sale > 300:
            print("Found high sale:", sale)
            count = count + 1
            
    print("Total high revenue days:", count)

    print("-" * 30)

    # --- PART 3: The 'While' Loop (Data Cleaning) ---
    # Scenario: removing '0' or bad data until the list is clean.
    print("3. Cleaning Data (Removing Zeros):")
    raw_data = [10, 0, 50, 0, 20]
    
    # While '0' exists inside the raw_data list, remove it
    while 0 in raw_data:
        raw_data.remove(0)
        print("Removed a zero... Current data:", raw_data)
        
    print("Final Cleaned Data:", raw_data)

    print("-" * 30)

    # --- PART 4: Break and Continue ---
    # Scenario: Searching for a specific error value (like -1).
    print("4. searching for Errors:")
    dataset = [12, 45, -1, 60, 100]
    
    for value in dataset:
        if value == -1:
            print("Error found! Corrupted data detected. Stopping analysis.")
            break # Stops the loop completely
        print("Checking value:", value)

# Run the analysis function
